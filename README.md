# libvirt-scripts

This is a collection of scripts I use to manage my libvirt cluster, feel free
to use them however you wish, no warranty given or implied. These scripts make
some assumptions about your configuration, but you can configure most options
in the ``config.sh`` file.

Your public SSH keys should be added to the ``ssh-keys`` directory, otherwise
you won't be able to login to your VMs
