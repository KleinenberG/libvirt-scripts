# libvirt-scripts

This is a collection of scripts I use to manage my libvirt cluster, feel free to
use them however you wish, no warranty given or implied. These scripts make
many assumptions about your configuration, most of which can be configured in
the ``config.sh`` file.

You SSH keys should be added to ``create-local-config.sh``, and my SSH keys
should be removed (unless you want me to be able to connect to your servers).
